Install NewRelicAPM? - Heroku addon


QUESTIONS:

Why doesn't the hidden delete method input field work on the restaurants info page?
- Need to add to app.php:
    // Register patch and delete http methods
    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
        Request::enableHttpMethodParameterOverride();

Is there a form action "back" to whatever page the user was on before?
- Nothing easy...
    Could pass around a previous page variable in all routes
    Could research further
